## About the project

The „PartyGame—Association“ Web App is developed by Valeriia Kozenasheva and Han Yang, two Master Students at the University of Cologne, supported by the Institute of Digital Humanities.

The idea behind the project is to create a web game for the parties and let people get acquainted with each other in a short period of time. The game aims to bring out more interactions between players and different teams. Players can also learn different ways to explain words and therefore enhance the communication between players during the game.
